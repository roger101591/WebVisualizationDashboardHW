# Unit 12 | Assignment - Web Visualization Dashboard (Lattitude)

## Background

In this assignment, I used HTML and CSS to visualize my analysis in a dashboard.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Weather

I created a visualization dashboard with 4 different scatterplots informing about the relationship between latitude and weather (temperature,humidity,windspeed, and cloudiness).
The dashboard will contain clickable plots that link to the plots own page. Each plot has detailed explanation and an enlarged scatterplot.

### Website Contents

The website contains 7 pages total, including:

* The landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four scatterplots, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A Comparisons page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  
* A Data Page that:
  * contains a csv table loaded as a table.
